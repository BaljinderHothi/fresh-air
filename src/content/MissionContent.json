  "text": "The healthier your lungs are, the more efficiently your body can take in oxygen, which boosts physical performance, improves energy levels, and supports overall well-being. Just like a rocket needs a strong engine and a steady supply of fuel to take off and reach new heights, your body relies on healthy lungs to power your daily activities and achieve peak performance. Healthy lungs also reduce the risk of respiratory illnesses, helping you live a longer and more active life."
